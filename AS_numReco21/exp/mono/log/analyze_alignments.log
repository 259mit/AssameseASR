The optional-silence phone sil occupies 55.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 50.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 12.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.2 hours of data, or 0.5 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 9.6% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (14,17.7,39)
